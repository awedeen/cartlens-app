    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of CartLens ("Service"), a Shopify application provided by CartLens ("we," "our," or "us"). By installing or using CartLens, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not install or use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. The Service</h2>
    <p>CartLens is a Shopify application that provides real-time cart activity tracking and analytics for Shopify merchants. The Service is made available through the Shopify App Store and operates as an embedded application within the Shopify admin.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must have an active Shopify store with the Online Store sales channel enabled to use CartLens. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent that you have the authority to bind your business to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscription and Billing</h2>
    <p>CartLens is offered on a subscription basis at $9.99 USD per month, following a 14-day free trial. All billing is handled exclusively through Shopify's billing system in accordance with Shopify's Partner Program Agreement. You will not be charged during the free trial period. After the trial, charges will appear on your Shopify invoice. You may cancel at any time by uninstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>4. Free Trial</h2>
    <p>New installations include a 14-day free trial. No payment information is required to begin the trial. At the end of the trial period, your subscription will automatically begin and you will be charged through Shopify's billing system unless you uninstall the app before the trial ends.</p>

    <h2>5. Cancellation</h2>
    <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time by uninstalling CartLens from your Shopify admin. Uninstalling the app terminates your subscription and stops future charges. We do not offer refunds for partial billing periods, but you will retain access to the Service through the end of your current paid period.</p>

    <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use CartLens only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service in any way that violates applicable law or Shopify's terms of service</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or extract the source code of the Service</li>
      <li>Use the Service to collect or store data beyond what is necessary for your legitimate business use</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of CartLens is also governed by our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. CartLens collects cart and visitor data from your Shopify storefront to provide the Service. You are responsible for ensuring your store's privacy policy discloses this data collection to your customers.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>CartLens and all related software, designs, and content are owned by us and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. These Terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks, logos, or branding. You retain ownership of your store's data.</p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses or other harmful components. Your use of the Service is at your sole risk.</p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the Service, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability to you for any claim arising from these Terms or the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the 30 days prior to the claim.</p>

    <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any third party's rights.</p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at our discretion, with or without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms. You may terminate your subscription at any time by uninstalling the app. Upon termination, your data will be deleted within 48 hours.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms. For material changes, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you.</p>

    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Orange County, California.</p>
